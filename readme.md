# Rapid API

Rapid JavaScript development environment for building RESTful API.

## Getting Started

Run `npm i`, then `npm start -s`.

Access URL will be: `localhost:3000/book`.

The available API methods are: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`.

**Note: you need to have `MongoDB` service up and running on your machine.**

## Todos:
1. Improve controller crud methods (Maybe move everything to model?).
2. Improve search query in controller.
3. post should be 'save' instead. Also patch should be 'update'.
4. controller should use the reveling module pattern to have all helpers inside scope.
