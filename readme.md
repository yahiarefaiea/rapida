# Rapid API

Rapid JavaScript development environment for building RESTful API.

## Getting Started

Run `npm i` then `npm start -s`

Access URL will be: `localhost:3000/book`

The available API methods are: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`

**Note: you need to have `MongoDB` service up and running on your machine.**

## Todos:
1. Improve controller crud methods (Maybe move everything to model?).
2. Improve search query in controller.
